# c-lang
I don't know what to tell you. I was bored and made a basic parser that is able to parse some C code.  
I won't work on this, this was purely made out of boredom.

It misses indexing and proper variable value management by the backend (and frontend on that matter, as it can't handle multi pointer). So might add that before letting this be.  
Will be adding loops for sure at some point. But that is later.
